## Introduction
An operational amplifier was designed using 28nm process.Focusing on single input single output and minimising noise. The minimum input voltage swing may be in the order of millivolts and is the output is expected (theoretically) in few volts.

## Circuit Implementation
The circuit mainly consists of three main stages;
* Differential stage
*   inverting 
*   differential
*
